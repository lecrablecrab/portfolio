This script generates a dynamic gallery page from images in the uploads folder. The images shown are random on each load. 
I am adding more functionality bit by bit. 
Video options are in the works. Mind you, I am not a real coder. 
I know how to script in shell, and I understand basic coding principles. 
I use AI to generate the code I use. 
Have fun, if you want to use it, great. 
If you have tips, let me hear them. 
To add new images to the script, run the "generate images" python on your server. 
It creates a json with filenames, which the script in the index page uses to choose random images on load.
The background is set to be the first image on load.
