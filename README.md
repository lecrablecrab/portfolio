This script generates a dynamic gallery page from images in the uploads folder. The images shown are random on each load. 
I am adding more functionality bit by bit. 
Video options are in the works. Mind you, I am not a real coder. 
I know how to script in shell, and I understand basic coding principles. 
I use AI to generate the code I use. 
Have fun, if you want to use it, great. 
If you have tips, let me hear them.
